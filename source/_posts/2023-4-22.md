# 1. Abstract

Studies have shown that the structure of the cyclobuta[1,2:3,4]di[5]annulene molecule is very unique, and due to its cyclic symmetry and double-bond configuration, many scholars believe that it may have aromaticity. However, there is still controversy in the academic community about whether this compound belongs to the aromatic group. Some scholars believe that it has aromaticity because its molecular plane is very flat and can satisfy Huckel’s rule, while others believe that the compound does not have aromaticity because there are no cyclic coplanar π electrons on its aromatic ring. Therefore, it is important to clearly
identify the aromaticity of cyclobuta[1,2:3,4]di[5]annulene for current research. In this study, theoretical and computational chemistry tools, Gaussian and Multiwfn, were used to explore the aromaticity of this compound.
